# Code Style

## TypeScript
- Use strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Avoid `any` type → use `unknown` or proper types
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use proper return types on functions

## Naming
- Use descriptive variable/function names
- PascalCase for components
- camelCase for variables/functions
- kebab-case for files/folders

## Structure
- One responsibility per function
- Keep files small (<200 lines)
- Extract reusable logic into hooks/utils
- Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports

## Comments
- Comment only complex logic
- No comments for obvious code
- Document edge cases
