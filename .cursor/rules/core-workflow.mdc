# Core Workflow

## Planning
- Use Plan Mode for complex tasks
- Clarify requirements before coding
- Break into vertical slices

## Implementation
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Run ESLint MCP after changes
- Use Context7 MCP for unfamiliar APIs
- Maintain strict TypeScript (no `any`)

## Quality
- Always lint before committing
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use TypeScript types everywhere
- Handle errors with try-catch

## Git
- Use feature branches
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Keep PRs small
- Run tests before pushing
