# Testing Standards

## Coverage
- Maintain 80%+ coverage for critical paths
- Write tests for all new features
- Update tests when modifying code

## Test Types
- Unit tests: Business logic, utilities
- Integration tests: APIs, database
- E2E tests: Critical user flows

## TDD
- Write failing tests first
- Implement to pass tests
- Keep tests fast (<100ms each)

## Quality
- Tests should be independent
- Mock external dependencies
- Use clear test names
